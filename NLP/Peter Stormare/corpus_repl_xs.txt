His challenge in life is to achieve a high degree of detachment.
I am always learning bounce back from failures and defeats.
I have the character and resilience of a true survivor.
I tend to keep others dependent longer than necessary.
The desire for luxury and comfort is especially strong in me.
Status is very important for me.
I's life path treads that dangerous ground where power lies - and can corrupt.
